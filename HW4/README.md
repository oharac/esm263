For HW 4, there are two parts to examine: setup and the Shiny app.

* setup.Rmd takes the original data and creates summarized maps of values by watershed.
* Shiny App (`server.R` and `ui.R`) implements a set of user-interactive widgets to change views and weights in the multi-criteria analysis.  The Shiny App uses the outputs created by `setup.Rmd`.
